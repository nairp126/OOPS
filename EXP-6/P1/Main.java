// // The above code demonstrates the use of packages in Java.
// // It includes the definition of a Main class that imports the Account class from the Balance package and creates an instance of it to display the balance.
// // The code is structured to promote modularity and reusability, allowing for better organization of classes and interfaces in larger projects.
// // The use of packages also helps in avoiding naming conflicts and provides a clear namespace for classes and interfaces.
